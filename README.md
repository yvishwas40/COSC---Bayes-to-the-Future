# 🫀 Bayes to the Future: Predicting Heart Disease with Data

This project uses a **Bayesian Network** to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient data. We clean the dataset, normalize features, build a Bayesian model using `pgmpy`, and perform probabilistic inference to answer health-related questions.
